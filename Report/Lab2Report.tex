\section{Get a Minix System}
	\subsection*{Approach}
		\paragraph{
			The two options for installing and running Minix were as a real partition and
			as a guest operating system on via an isolated, simulated machine.  The
			preferred option was to run Minix via the simulated machine since Minix
			would be isolated from the real machine and would thereby, minimize
			corruption or data lost in the real machine.
